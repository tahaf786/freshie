## Overview
This project aims to predict stock price trends (upward or downward) using historical stock data and machine learning techniques. The model is trained on features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, Moving Averages, and Relative Strength Index (RSI) to predict whether the stock price will increase or decrease the next day.

---

## Features
- **Data Collection**: Fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.
- **Feature Engineering**: Computes technical indicators like Moving Averages, RSI, and Daily Returns.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and LSTM for trend prediction.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Deployment**: Deploys the model as a web app using Streamlit.

---

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-trend-prediction.git
   cd stock-trend-prediction
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
1. **Data Collection**:
   - Run the `data_collection.py` script to download historical stock data:
     ```bash
     python data_collection.py
     ```

2. **Training the Model**:
   - Train the model using the `train_model.py` script:
     ```bash
     python train_model.py
     ```

3. **Running the Web App**:
   - Launch the Streamlit app to interact with the model:
     ```bash
     streamlit run app.py
     ```
